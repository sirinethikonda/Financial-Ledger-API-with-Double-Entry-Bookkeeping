# Ledger API(a Financial Ledger API with Double-Entry Bookkeeping):
a Financial Ledger API with Double-Entry Bookkeeping is a robust, ledger-based banking and payment processing API built with Spring Boot 3 and Java 17.

This project was engineered to manage a complex, real-worldfinancial domain model, using a double-entry bookkeeping system for transaction integrity and audibility. It accurately handles core banking features, ensuring every movement of money is accounted for through a permanent audit trail.

including:

* Cash deposits and transfers
* Real-time transaction processing
* Calculated Balance Integrity
* Immutable Audit Trail & Ledger Audibility

**The main purpose of the project**

My goal is to highlight my ability to create complex systems with strict business logic. That's what inspired the decision for a ledger-based system. While having a simple balance column in the database would have been much easier to implement, a ledger-based approach is far more robust as it provides an immutable history of every transaction, making it audit-ready and resilient to data corruption.

**Features**

* Double-Entry Bookkeeping: Every transaction (Deposit or Transfer)         generates balanced debit and credit entries in the ledger for full auditability.
* Real-time Balance Calculation: Balances are calculated on-demand by summing ledger entries (SUM(amount)), ensuring they are always a direct reflection of the transaction history.
* Insufficient Funds Prevention: Atomic checks at the service level prevent accounts from reaching negative balances.
* Fully Dockerized: Ready-to-use docker-compose.yml for the application and MySQL 8.0 database.
* Global Exception Handling: Custom business exceptions (like InsufficientBalanceException) return clean, informative API responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.

**Technical highlights**

* Stack: Java 17, Spring Boot 3, MySQL 8, Docker.
* Precision: Uses BigDecimal for all monetary calculations to avoid  floating-point errors common with Double.
* Containerization: Fully containerized with a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for a "one-command" setup.
* ACID Integrity: Uses Spring’s @Transactional to ensure that if one "leg" of a transfer fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, maintaining atomicity.

**ScreenShots**


**Design Decisions**

Double-Entry Implementation
For every Transfer request:

* A record is created in the transactions table to document the event.
* A Debit entry (negative amount) is added to ledger_entries for the source account.
* A Credit entry (positive amount) is added to ledger_entries for the destination account.
* The sum of these entries for the specific transaction ID must equal zero.
                        
**ACID Properties**

* Atomicity: Guaranteed by @Transactional. Both ledger entries must succeed, or none will be persisted.
* Consistency: The system ensures the ledger is always balanced and follows the rules defined in AccountType and Status enums.
* Isolation: Uses the default RDBMS isolation level to handle concurrent transfer requests safely, preventing race conditions.
* Durability: All records are persisted in a Docker-managed MySQL volume.

**Balance Calculation & Prevention**

Balance is marked as @Transient in the Account model. It is calculated via a query: SELECT SUM(amount) FROM ledger_entry WHERE account_id = :id. Negative Balance Prevention: Before any debit, the service calculates the current balance. If CurrentBalance < RequestedAmount, an InsufficientBalanceException is thrown, triggering a rollback.

**Setup & Execution**

*Prerequisites:
* Docker Desktop

* Maven 3.8+

* Java 17 (JRE)

###1. Build the Project
* Open your terminal in the project root and run:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests
###2. Run with Docker
 
    docker-compose up --build -d  
    
**The API will be available at http://localhost:8080/api and the database at localhost:3307**

**API Testing (Postman) :**
   A Postman collection is recommended for testing. Key endpoints include:
     
     POST /api/accounts: Create a new ledger account.
     POST /api/transactions/deposit: Add funds to an account (Credit).
     POST /api/transactions/transfer: Move funds between accounts (Debit + Credit).
